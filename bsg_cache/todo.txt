1. Does the pipeline pull the load data directly from the dma?
2. If dma accessing data memory, stall and wait for store buffer to drain
3. Recover using address in tag verify stage

DMA must wait until store buffer is empty
- Pipeline must stall and yumi signal must stay asserted

Load->Load
Load->Store
- Will write new tag to tag memory and hit/miss will be re-evaluated on it's own. Will write to store buffer after hit is detected
Store->Load
- Will write new tag to tag memory and hit/miss will be re-evaluated on it's own
Store->Store
